I don't feel like doing anything I need to do for school. Anyways:

Rarely I get chest pains, which have ramped up lately. Along with nighttime heart palpitations this might be a heart attack, but that would mean I've been having one for over a month, which is silly (if it isn't please contact immediately).

Might try and read Homestuck^2, given 4/13 is around the corner, but I've heard plenty of people say it's bad. People say this about the Epilogues too but I went ahead anyways.

I'm really thinking of dumping a rant about my current mental state, but I think I'll reserve that for the people I know in real life. Which is code for "I'm never telling anyone". I don't know why I'm so scared to tell anyone.

Thats it for today.
