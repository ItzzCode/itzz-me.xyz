In keeping of with the great tradition of abandoning projects, I haven't posted in 16 days!

Aight, let's get going. It was quite predictable that I'd drop coolquest really, given how many others i've dropped. Talking about that, I've got another soon to die project up. It's a spec for an esolang where there is no false. Silly I know. Find it [here](https://github.com/ItzzCode/veritas). If you see the last commit was init in a few days, you know what happened.

Also, I hope I set it up right, because there should now be an RSS feed for these posts. Like and subscribe and hit- no- smash the bell!

In other news, I'm still kinda depressed.

That's all now.
