In ***'MURICA***, the current date is 3/14, which are the first three digits of the math constant pi. We can keep going into the digits (3.14*159*2) and derive the time 1:59 PM (because AM is inconvinient for most). Sadly, in places using 24 hour time, doing 3.14*1592* doesn't quite work, given that 15:92 is most definitely not a time. (You could carry it over? As in: 16:33 I think.)

Sadly, my math class does not coincide with 1:59. :(

That's all for today.
