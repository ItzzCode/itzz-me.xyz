Sometimes I begin humming songs to myself with noticing for a few seconds. Typically these are songs I've heard recently, like within that week. Sometimes i hum songs that I hadn't heard for months. Maybe I'm just adding the soundtrack to the series of my own life.

In Feburary I took a small interest for the stars. My mom had an old camera from the early 2010's so I took it outside— with a frankly terrible tripod— and pointed it up to the night sky. The pictures were subpar, had a shake, some light polution and that. I'll add the images here once I can get to my laptop.

My heart has been doing random palpatations at night. It's quite annoying. I don't know if I should be concerned.

Today I was thinking about the New Year. I've noted something about anniversaries. For example, my birthday. I go most of the year certain about my age. When prompted for it, I confidently state my age. Except for one week, that being the week of my birthday, because if I'm asked for my age then, I must recall my own birthday, unless I wan't to say I'm younger than I am. Something similar applies to the New Years, where you need to recall that it happened when you need to state the current year. Maybe for now, 3 months into 2023, this won't be an issue, but it surely will in 9 months.

That's it I guess.
