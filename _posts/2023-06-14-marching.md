Whoops. Didn't post for a month lol.

So, in the time, I have finished my 9th grade year (US), and it is now summer. I have summer school, because I goofed up. ALso, as part of my band program, I must attend rehearsals and that.

I did not do too well on those rehearsals. Some stuff they made us do looked honestly goofy. Holding up my marching instrument (baritone) was just plain terrible. I don't look forward to combining the marching aspects with the playing aspects. One highlight though,  there were plenty of new faces (and some familiar ones) who were incoming 9th graders.

I've been doing better emotionally with the burden of the school year over. I've been more active too, doing things like bike commuting and the before mentioned marching band.

Does anyone even read these? If you want, go ahead and [tell me](https://itzzcode.github.io/about#contacts) you do, I'd appreciate it.

That's all.
