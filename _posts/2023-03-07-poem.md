Tick, the clock hand moves. <br />
Tick, the hand moves again. <br />
Tick, the hand reaches straight for the sky. <br />

The sky on cue displays the stars of the night. <br />
Some stars are not stationary, <br />
Instead they fall, flutter, coming closer. <br />
These are not stars, in fact these are snowflakes. <br />

Tick, the hand continues. <br />
Tick, it becomes nearly horrizontal. <br />
Tick, the hand points through the window. <br />

Outside the window, the snowflakes accumulate, <br />
Rising up and beyond several objects outside; <br />
But another tick interrupts the scene, <br />
As the hand moves away once again. <br />

Tick, the hand strays off. <br />
Tick, it goes again. <br />
Slam, a door nearby is shut quickly. <br />

A woman quickly takes off her boots, <br />
Which have filled with snow. <br />
She moves to the ticking clock, <br />
And turns it off. <br />

(There really is no meaning here, I just wrote a story :] )
