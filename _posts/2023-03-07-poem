Tick, the clock hand moves.
Tick, the hand moves again.
Tick, the hand reaches straight for the sky.

The sky on cue displays the stars of the night.
Some stars are not stationary,
Instead they fall, flutter, coming closer.
These are not stars, in fact these are snowflakes.

Tick, the hand continues.
Tick, it becomes nearly horrizontal.
Tick, the hand points through the window.

Outside the window, the snowflakes accumulate,
Rising up and beyond several objects outside;
But another tick interrupts the scene,
As the hand moves away once again.

Tick, the hand strays off.
Tick, it goes again.
Slam, a door nearby is shut quickly.

A woman quickly takes off her boots,
Which have filled with snow.
She moves to the ticking clock,
And turns it off.

(There really is no meaning here, I just wrote a story :] )
