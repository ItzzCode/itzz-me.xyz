This is my first post in TWO! (10<sub>2</sub> [2 {II}]) MONTHS.

I've been completely failing academically and emotionally thanks to my 10th grade (US) year. Not really my 10th grade, but myself, but whatever.

Also, I know you're gonna read this, individual who's name starts with a J and ends with an N.

Thats all, see y'all next year :3
