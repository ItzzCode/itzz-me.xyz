So if you looked at this website's source code, you would notice that this website uses Jekyll as a Static Website Generator. This works pretty well, and is why the website got online right now, as opposed to sometime in the summer. It also allowed me to just put up the source code on GitHub, which means I can just use GitHub pages for free (yay!).

Even then, I have encountered some pesky things about the current setup.
* Overall inexpirience ( This is more of a me thing but still )
* GitHub Pages ( I'd like to use another domain, like itzz-me.xyz, but can't do that for now. Furthermore GitHub takes about 5-10 minutes to actually register changes to the site. )
* Weird Jekyll Shenanigans ( If you go to the "Thoughts 2" post, you'll notice broken images. This is because Jekyll is a prick and does not recognize the folder I'm storing those images in.)

It is still quite a nice expirience using Jekyll on this website (and anyways I'm not changing the website's foundation so quickly, not yet).

I guess that's it then.
