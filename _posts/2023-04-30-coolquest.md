I've been working on a game (client) for a cool concept i have called coolquest. Now, it's not really operational at any level yet, i have no docs, nor a server, so...

It's lightly inspired by [breadquest](https://ostracodapps.com:2626/), and some strategic wargames.

If you want, check out my [current progress](https://github.com/ItzzCode/CoolQuestItzzicClient/)!
