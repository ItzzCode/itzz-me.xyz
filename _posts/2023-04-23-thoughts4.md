Recently it has been more eventful. I went to some competitions for band, and did ok (as a group) and terribly (individually). The other group my band is split into did much better though.

In other news, I am still in a personal freefall.

I've been hearing about the protests in Paris for quite a while. It is weird how little I hear of it given it's importance. This goes for East Palestine, USA, and other events that I think are eventful.

That's all.
