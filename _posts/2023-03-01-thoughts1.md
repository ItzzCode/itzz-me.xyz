I'm feeling quite down. Somehow, by Februrary, I managed to nosedive so hard that I was failing 4 classes, although it has improved ( I hope ). I get home and I proceed to lie in bed until I realize it's suddenlly 6:33 PM and none of the assignments I told myself I'd do have even been started. I'm scared to really go into detail with my *mother* yet I really want to. No idea what I'm doing, not gonna lie.
